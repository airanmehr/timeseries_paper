        when power is computer for 1000 simulations with 
        $s\in\{0.025,0.05,0.075,0.1\}$. Frequency Increment 
        Test (FIT), Gaussian Process (GP), \comale\ ($\Hc$) and 
        Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) are compared for different initial 
        carrier frequency $\nu_0$. For all sequencing coverages, \comale\ 
        outperform other methods. When coverage is not high 
        ($\lambda\in\{30,100\}$) and initial frequency is low (hard sweep), 
        \comale\ significantly perform better than others.}
