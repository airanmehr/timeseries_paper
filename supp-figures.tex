          individuals when $N_e=10^6$ and $\mu=10^{-9}$. The $x$-axis

		Trajectory of three different variants that are increasing

		true allele frequency is not known. Here we draw the
		posterior distribution of the allele frequency at each time
		point using box plot. The median of each distribution is
		denoted by dots. The variance of each box is seen to be
		inversely related to the depth of the measurement. For instance, 
		generation 59 is sequenced with higher coverage than generation 37. 
		As a result, variance of observations in generation 59 is 
		considerably 
		smaller.}

	\caption{{\bf Theoretical (Markov chain) and Empirical
            trajectories of favored allele for hard and soft sweep
            scenarios.}\\  Theoretical (A,C) and empirical (B,D) trajectories 
            of 
            the
          frequency of the favored allele are computed for $1000$ 
          simulations of populations with 
          $1000$ diploid individuals. Each curve shows the mean and the 95\% 
          confidence
          interval.  Panels A and C represent theoretical Markov chain
          based calculations of the favored allele frequency under
          hard ($\nu_0$ is small), and soft sweep due to standing
          variation (higher $\nu_0$), for a range of values of
          $s$. Note that $s=0$ corresponds to neutral
          evolution. Similarly, panels B and D show the empirical
          forward simulations of populations under the same selection
          regimes, and hard/soft-sweep scenarios. The first $50$
          generations are shaded in gray to represent the typical
          sampling span of EE experiments. The plot illustrates the
          difficulty of EE experiments in having to predict selection
          at a very early stage of the sweep. The signal is slightly
          stronger under standing variation scenario. The theoretical
          and empirical simulations are in close correspondence. }

			evolution experiment with restricted number of founder
			lines.}\\ For the experiment, $F=200$ founders were selected
		from a larger population size ($N_e=10^{-6}$), and evolved
		under neutral scenario ($s=0$). The statistics for
		Tajima's $D$ (left), Fay Wu's $H$ (middle) and SFSelect were
		computed for 1000 neutral simulations and the mean and 95\%
		confidence interval plotted. Under neutral evolution, all
		the statistics are expected to vary around a fixed mean
		through time. However, under selective constraint, $D$ and
		$H$ take negative values, while SFSelect take positive
		values. In experimental evolution, bottleneck effect will
		suppress the signal of selection, especially in early
		generations. }

	allele 
	(at position 500K) is drawn as function of position and time for neutral 
	(top) and selection(bottom) regimes.
	For sake of illustration, we assumed that at generations 0, LD of all 
	variants with the favored allele is 0.5, initial frequency of the favored 
	allele is 0.1, recombination rate is $r=2\times10^{-8}$ (top). The 
	selection strength is 0 and 0.05 for neutral and selection regimes, 
	respectively. As expected LD decay exponentially  through space and time. 
	However, selection causes LD to increase then decrease.}

		strength determine dynamic of LD. The vertical dashed line denotes the
