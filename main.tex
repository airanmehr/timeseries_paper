\begin{abstract}
The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has made it possible to study genomic data throughout time. This modern paradigm, Evolve-and-Resequence (E\&R), enables us to make more accurate and robust inferences, i.e. estimate model parameters, using multiple observations along generations. In this paper, we consider the recently repopularized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to model the genomic time series of E\&R. In fact, RNN is used as a generative model which for a initial estate and a choice of model parameter generates a sequence. Parameter estimation procedure involves a (non-convex) optimization of least square loss between observed sequence data and RNN-generated sequence with respect to model parameter. Backpropagation-in-time, is effectively used to compute gradients of objective function, and stochastic gradient descent with momentum algorithm is used for  optimization. Experimental study on simulated data shows RNN provides significantly more accurate and robust estimates in shorter times.
