\begin{abstract}
Experimental evolution studies are a powerful tool for observing
molecular evolution at work in a controlled environment. The availability of
next-generation sequencing has made it possible to study the genetic trajectory 
of the population at different time points. Methods for investigating 
time-series genomic data are under active development, including recent work by 
Terhorst et al., that uses a Gaussian process approximation to a 
multi-locus Wright-Fisher process.  
In this research, we revisit the problem of detecting selection in short amount 
of time using classical methods such as
Tajima's S and Fay Wu's H and a proposed method which fits a logistic
function to the trajectories of allele frequencies at every locus. An extensive
simulation study shows the proposed method has a superior performance
over conventional method both in hard and soft sweeps.

\section{Introduction}
Genetic adaptation is \emph{the} central evolutionary process and is at the
 core of some of the greatest challenges facing humanity.  
 HIV would likely
  cause nothing more than harmless fever without the
ability of the virus to adapt and eventually destroy the immune system. 
Cancer would be much more straightforward to treat if not for
tumor's ability to adapt to anti-cancer drugs. 
Malaria could be treated with cheap drugs such as quinine instead of 
being one of the world's worst killers. 
Crop pests would be manageable with small doses of safe insecticides 
instead of requiring applications of ever increasing amounts of a diverse array 
of powerful chemicals. [[Example for Bacteria and TB and some references]]
In both disease and agriculture, we find ourselves in an arms race due to the
ability of organisms to adapt.

Adaptation leaves a variety of detectable signatures in
genomes \cite{nielsen2005genomic,akey2009constructing,
kreitman2000methods,messer2013population,sabeti2006positive}.
The rapid expansion of adaptive alleles in populations leads to both an excess
of functional changes between species and distortions in polymorphism patterns
known as selective sweeps~\cite{nielsen2005genomic}. The signatures of
selective sweeps, which include reduction of levels of polymorphism and the
presence of too many rare alleles~\cite{nielsen2005genomic,
przeworski2002signature}, have been the basis for assessing genomic
patterns in many genome scans for adaptation. Depending on the
\emph{1)data availability}, e.g. allele frequency vs. haplotype, single vs 
multiple  population, single-snapshot vs time-series observation and 
\emph{2)objective of the test}, e.g. detecting recent or ancient
sweep, and \emph{3)simulation model}, e.g. statistical-test vs likelihood-based 
models, empirical recipes for detecting selection are available for each
scenario \cite{sabeti2006positive}.

For example, given allele frequency, a whole family of test such as 
Tajima's \emph{D} ~\cite{tajima1989statistical}, 
Fay and Wu's \emph{H}~\cite{fay2000hitchhiking}, 
SFSelect~\cite{ronen2013learning} compute test statistic as "\emph{a}"
\footnote{Convex combination is a linear combination which weights are positive
	 and sum to one. Under a Bayesian prospective, it can be regarded as a
	  \emph{expectation} which the prior distribution is determined by the
	   weights. As with Bayesian inference, using a \emph{not-reasonable prior}
	    distribution would lead to poor results.} 
	convex 
combination of Site Frequency 
Spectrum(SFS)~\cite{achaz2009frequency} 
(Figure \ref{fig:afs}. 
However, despite their simplicity and intuitiveness, it has been shown that
 ~\cite{ptak2002evidence, ramos2002statistical} SFS-based 
 tests often fail 
 to discriminate between positive selection and a dynamic
demographic processes. Also, more recently, Frequency Increment
 Test(FIT) \cite{feder2014Identifying} is  proposed to test whether a
  time-series of allele-frequencies is subjected to a 
  selection pressure.

\paragraph{Experimental Evolution}
Recent advances of whole genome sequencing has enabled us to sequence 
populations at a reasonable cost, such that one could design \emph{experiments} 
to study different forces of \emph{evolution} in-action. \emph{Experimental 
evolution} is the study of the evolutionary processes of a model organism in a 
controlled  
\cite{hegreness2006equivalence,lang2013pervasive,orozco2012adaptation,
	lang2011genetic,barrick2009genome,bollback2007clonal,oz2014strength} 
or natural 
	\cite{maldarelli2013hiv,reid2011new,denef2012situ,winters2012development,
	daniels2013genetic,barrett2008natural,bergland2014genomic} environment.

Types of evolution experiments \cite{Barrick2013Genome} [to be added]

While constraints such as small population sizes, limited timescales and 
oversimplified  laboratory
 environments limits interpreting experimental evolution results, it has
  been used to test different hypothesis~\cite{kawecki2012experimental}
   regarding
mutation and adaptation, 
genetic drift and inbreeding, 
environmental variability,
sexual selection and conflict, 
kin selection and cooperation
life history and sex allocation, 
sexual reproduction and mating systems, 
behavior and cognition, 
host–parasite interactions, 
speciation
repeatability of evolution.

In addition, time-series \emph{models} is shown to be more powerful 
\cite{boyko2008assessing,desai2008polymorphism,sawyer1992population} 
than single-snapshot data.
In particular, dynamic data has been used to estimate model parameters 
including population size
\cite{williamson1999using,wang2001pseudo,pollak1983new,waples1989generalized,
	Terhorst2015Multi}
strength of selection
\cite{mathieson2013estimating,illingworth2011distinguishing,Terhorst2015Multi,
	bollback2008estimation,illingworth2012quantifying,malaspinas2012estimating,
	Steinrücken2014a, malaspinas2012estimating}, allele age
 \cite{malaspinas2012estimating}
recombination rate~\cite{Terhorst2015Multi}  and mutation
 rate~\cite{Barrick2013Genome, Terhorst2015Multi}. 

Linked-loci time-series (spatio-temporal) methods 
\cite{illingworth2011distinguishing,illingworth2012quantifying,
	Barrick2013Genome,Terhorst2015Multi} incorporate linkage into computation
 which makes it cumbersome. Theoretical diffusion approximation method has also 
 developed for neutral allele frequencies~\cite{Ewens2012Mathematical, 
 kimura1955solution}
neutral SFS~\cite{evans2007non}, neutral allele
 frequencies~\cite{song2012simple}.

Experimental evolution (including evolve and re-sequence paradigms)
have become increasingly popular as a complementary tool to understand
the forces of selection, allowing for controlled environments,
specific selection constraints. Examples of experimental evolution
studies abound in sexual populations, particularly in fruitfly. Burke
et al.~\cite{Barrick2013Genome} evolved flies for over $600$ generations 
under
selection for accelerated development, and noted that evolution for
sexual populations is very different from those of asexual populations
(e.g., Lenski): the effects of clonal interference is slower
due to recombination that allows for the incorporation of multiple
beneficial alleles, but there are fewer, unconditionally advantageous
alleles that arise at the onset of selection. Rose and
Colleagues~\cite{rose1994evolutionary} created $200$ experimentally evolved
populations selected for different traits, starting with $10$ initial
populations. Zhou et al. evolved flies to adapt to low oxygen
environment (hypoxia) for over $300$ generations, and identified many
genes involved in hypoxia tolerance~\cite{zhou2011experimental}.  Instead, 
they observed
incomplete fixation (`soft-sweeps') due in part to standing variation,
changing selection coefficients, and small fitness effects. Similarly, Jha et
 al. \cite{jha2015whole} identified genes under selection for egg size in flies.
Barrick et al. \cite{barrick2009genome} evolved a population of 
\emph{Escherichia coli} for 40,000 generations.

Much like in natural populations, many of these studies also
sequenced/genotyped only the latest population. However, the emergence
of NGS and related technologies has made it feasible to sequence the
evolving population at multiple time points in its evolution. At the
same time, for small organisms where a single animal does not provide
enough DNA, it is more effective to pool together individuals in the
population at a particular time point, in a single sequencing
experiment. Thus, instead of individual genotypes, we obtain
frequencies of the derived allele at all loci at different time
points. Methods for analyzing such time series pooled sequence data
are only just being developed.

\paragraph{Asexual vs Sexual}
\cite{bollback2008estimation,lenski1991long,lang2013pervasive} [to be 
added]

\section{Background}
\paragraph{Notation} Let $\bfX \triangleq (X_{ijk}) \in [0, 1]^{T \times 
M\times R}$ denote the population frequency where $T$ is the number of samples 
in time, $M$ is the number of segregating sites, and $R$ is the number of 
replicates. Samples in time are taken such that $\tau_1<\tau_2,\cdots<\tau_T$.
To simplify our notation, we define $x_t$ as a allele frequency of a site in a
 replicate, and we denote it by $\nu_t$ if such a site is directly under 
 selection with the strength $s$. I.E., $\nu_t$ can be regarded as frequency of 
 the carrier in the  population.
\paragraph{Simulations}
For each experiment a diploid population is created and evolved as follows. 
\begin{enumerate}[I.]
	\item {\bf Creating initial founder line haplotypes}
	First using msms program, we created neutral populations for $F$ founding 
	haplotypes with \emph{default} parameters \texttt{\$./msms <F> 1 -t 
	<2$\mu$LNe> 
		-r <2rNeL> 
		<L>} 
	where $F=200$ is number of founder lines, $N_e=10^6$ is 
	effective 
	population size, $r=2*10^{-8}$ is recombination rate and $\mu=2\times 
	10^{-9}$ is mutation rate and  $L=50K$ is the window size in base pairs 
	which gives $\theta=2\mu N_eL=200$ and $\rho=2N_erL=2000$. For default 
	parameter, the expected number of segregating sites in a window is 
	\beqq
	\Ebb[M]=\theta \sum_{i=1}^{F-1}\frac{1}{i}=1175
	\eeqq
	\item{\bf Creating initial diploid population} 
	To implement similar setting for experimental evolution of diploid 
	organisms, 
	initial  haplotypes first cloned to create $F$ diploid homozygotes. Then 
	each 
	diploid individual is  cloned $N/F$ times to yield diploid population of 
	size 
	$N$.
	\item{\bf Forward Simulation}
	Given initial diploid population, position of the site under selection, 
	selection 
	strength $s$, number of replicates $R=3$, recombination rate 
	$r=2\times10^{-8}$ 
	and sampling times $\Tc=\{10,20,30,40,50\}$, \texttt{simuPop} is used to 
	perform
	forward simulation and  compute allele frequencies for all of the $R$ 
	replicates. Also, to avoid spurious simulation samples, simulation results 
	are constrained to those that the beneficial allele escapes stochastic loss 
	of genetic drift and \emph{establishes} in all the replicates. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Hard and Soft Sweep}
In this paper, we only study (positive) selection with single beneficial allele 
under selective sweep, i.e. favored allele is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) 
with its nearby loci. Selective sweeps are classified by the amount of 
variation exist in the individuals carrying adaptive allele. By definition, 
hard sweep is the case when all the carriers coalesce after onset of selection 
and thus diversity between carriers is at its minimum. 
In general, soft sweep is difficult to detect. We conduct experiments, so that 
evaluate prediction performance of the proposed method under hard and soft 
sweeps with different selection strengths. Since here we consider random mating 
with no de novo mutations, soft sweep can only happen in standing variation 
where the site under selection is at frequency is larger than $1/F$. In 
contrast, hard sweep experiments are those that their adaptive allele is at its 
minim frequency, $1/F$, at the onset of selection.


\paragraph{Challenges}
The main constraint in the experimental evolution experiments, is the 
sampling-time-span (STS) $\tau=\tau_T-\tau_0$, the number of generations 
between the first and last generation in the time-series data, which primarily 
determined organism generation time. In other words, for wide range of values 
of $s$ (not very strong selection), STS will be significantly smaller than 
fixation time. As a result, methods for detecting selection on static data, 
which work the best when the beneficial allele is close to fixation, would not 
work properly for dynamic data.

Moreover, in controlled experimental evolution, a population is evolve and 
inbreed under a selective pressure. This scenario which population size is 
effectively reduces from large number of wild type (e.g.D. melanogaster 
$N_e\approx10^6$ ) to a small number (typically $F$ is between 100-1000) of 
founder lines for EE, resembles a severe population bottleneck. This phenomena 
makes genetic drift quite strong and confounds polymorphism summary statistics 
and makes difficult to detecting selection weaker selections.

\newpage
\section{Results}
Selective sweep is a complex random process which under infinite site assumption
only depends on selection strength,
population size and the underlying genealogy at the onset of 
selection. 
As a result, the change in different population statistics, including 
\emph{site 
allele frequencies}(AF), \emph{site frequency spectrum}(SFS) and \emph{linkage 
disequilibrium}(LD), can be attributed to the selection event.
However, other independent processes such as genetic drift, 
population expansion/bottleneck and recombination cause AF,SFS and LD to 
change, respectively. Therefore, obtaining a clear understanding of dynamics of 
selective sweep  requires disentangling effects of natural selection from 
those of neutral evolution and demography.

 In the following, we examine the dynamics of AF and SFS in the experimental 
 evolution and evaluate their power in identification of selection 
 events. 
 The "identification" of a selection event can be done in 
 different levels of detail. At coarsest level, identification can be done by 
 determining whether a region 
 (e.g. a window of 50Kbp, or a gene) on genome is under selection. In the rest, 
 we consider this task to 
 be the task of \emph{detection}.
 Then, finding the causal 
 mutation/allele would be a more elaborate identification of selection, 
 henceforth, \emph{locating} selection. 
 Finally, estimating model parameters such as strength of selection and 
 overdominance at the site fully describes the selective sweep.
 



\paragraph{Allele Frequencies}
Selection and genetic drift are the two main 
\emph{independent} evolutionary 
forces that cause change in allele frequencies, each 
generation. 
In the simplest case, models for neutral evolution of a 
single-locus can be 
used to derive a null distribution in order to detect the 
region under 
selection or locate the 
adaptive allele.
For example, Feder et al. 
\cite{feder2014Identifying} proposed a (continues-time 
continues-state) 
Brownian motion process for modeling variation of allele 
frequencies under 
genetic drift. Basically, given current allele frequency 
$\nu_t$ at a site 
Brownian motion approximation assumes future-generations allele 
frequencies are drawn from the Gaussian distribution
\beq
\nu_{t+\tau}\sim 
\Nc\left(\nu_t,\frac{2\nu_t(1-\nu_t)}{N_e}\tau\right) 
\label{eq:brown}
\eeq
Using \eqref{eq:brown}, Frequency Increment Test (FIT) 
\cite{feder2014Identifying} computes p-value of 
time-series data by a Student's t-test. However, Brownian 
motion is a poor 
approximation of the actual genetic drift process when 1) 
$\nu_t$ is not close 
to $0.5$, 2) when $\tau$ is large. A the start of selection 
site frequencies 
are distributed according to SFS of a neutral population, and 
thus most of the 
sites are at low frequencies Figure \ref{fig:afs}. Thus if the selecting site 
is 
chosen randomly 
with high probability its frequency will be far 0.5. 
Moreover, in many 
experimental evolution experiments STS $\tau$ is chosen be 
large, e.g. of the order of 10 to 
100 generations.


Instead, probabilities of trajectories can be computed using 
a 
(discrete-time discrete-state-space) Markov Chain with 
transition matrix $P$
\beq
P_{i,j}=\pr\left(\nu_{t+1}=\frac{j}{2N} \left| 
\nu_{t}=\frac{i}{2N}\right)={2N 
	\choose j} \right. 
\nu_{t}^j (1-\nu_{t})^{2N-j}  
\eeq
which transition probabilities for $\tau$ generations ahead 
can be computed by 
powering the transition matrix to $\tau$.
Figure \ref{fig:markov} illustrates expected and observed distribution of 
frequencies after 
1, 10 and 100 generations when starting frequency is 0.005 (top) and 0.1 
(bottom) for Brownian motion and Markov chain. Brownian motion 
exhibits poor prediction of distributions of allele frequencies when starting 
frequency is far from 
0.5. On the other hand, Markov chain provides an accurate distribution of 
allele frequencies 
for future generations, under genetic drift.

On the other hand, alternative models for single-locus selection can be 
utilized to estimate strength of selection and robustly 
detect and locate selection by 
evaluating two hypotheses in order to perform likelihood ratio tests.
In a pure selection process with no drift, i.e. infinite 
population size, 
dynamic of allele frequencies 
can be well approximated by the logistic function (see 
Appendix \ref{app:af} 
for 
derivation)
\beq
\nu_t=\sigma(st+\eta(\nu_0))\label{eq:nut}
\eeq
where $\sigma(x)=1/(1+e^{-x})$ is the logistic function, and 
$\eta(x)=\log(x)/\log(1-x)$ is inverse of the 
logistic, aka logit, function. Figure \ref{fig:sweep} depicts 
the behavior of 
the logistic model for site allele frequencies and the 
default sampling time 
span(STS). Without genetic drift, soft sweeps are easier to 
detect, 
because the logistic function happens to have steeper slope 
in th STS than 
those of hard sweeps. In addition, even in infinite 
population size, it is 
difficult differentiate between weak selections and genetic 
drift (a horizontal 
line), in 50 generations.


As shown in Figures \ref{fig:dynamic-weak} and \ref{fig:dynamic-strong} (first 
row), the approximate logistic model is consistent with 
simulated data and we 
use it to estimate the strength of selection for 
each site by a simple regression (see \ref{sec:regression} 
for details).

Given an estimate for $s$, the Markov chain with transition 
probabilities 
(\cite{Ewens2012Mathematical}, eq 1.58-59)
\beq
Q_{i,j}(s)&=\pr\left(\nu_{t+1}=\frac{j}{2N} \left| 
\nu_{t}=\frac{i}{2N}\right)={2N 
	\choose j} \right. 
\hat{\nu}_{t+1}^{j} (1-\hat{\nu}_{t+1})^{2N-j},\\
\hat{\nu}_{t+1}&=\sigma(\hat{s}+\eta(\nu_t))\label{eq:markovs}
\eeq
computes probabilities of time-series under the alternative 
model. Figure \ref{fig:markovs} shows that the predicted distributions of 
frequencies using Markov chain \ref{eq:markovs} is consistent with simulation 
data.

Likelihood of the trajectories under null and alternative 
hypothesis can be 
computed to perform likelihood ratio tests which provide 
predictors that are 
robust to pathological false-positives 
\cite{feder2014Identifying}. 
Specifically, for each site, we define the likelihood-ratio 
predictor
\beq \label{eq:lrt}
\Lambda(\hat{s}) = \hat{s}\log 
\left(\frac{\Lc(\bfx|s=\hat{s})}{\Lc(\bfx|s=0)}\right)
\eeq
where $\bfx$ is the vector of trajectories and $\Lc$ is the 
likelihood function 
defined by the Markov chain with transition 
\eqref{eq:markovs}.

\paragraph{Site Frequency Spectrum} SFS (Figure 
\ref{fig:afs}) is the 
distribution of allele 
frequencies in a genomic region.
Historically, SFS of static data has been extensively used to 
"detect" genetic 
adaption and demographic changes in a population. Basically, 
SFS is measure of diversity in a genomic region computed from allele 
frequencies. 
In general, reduction in diversity is a signal of 
selection, and detecting selection based on the reduction in 
genomic diversity is a subtle task, because 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item  in soft sweeps the genomic diversity is not is not 
	necessarily 
	reduced.
	\item even in hard sweeps with no recombination, the 
	reduction diversity is 
	significant only when the SFS sample is taken close to 
	fixation (not too 
	far prior or after fixation)
	\item SFS change in the same way for both selection an 
	demography changes. 
\end{enumerate}

Although conditions (hard sweep with no recombination, not 
far from 
fixation, and random-mating and constant size population ) 
for detecting 
selection based on SFS are very restrictive, SFS-based tests 
are simple and 
inexpensive to use and often used in combination with 
other tests~\cite{}. 

In practice, SFS distribution is \emph{sclarized} by a 
weighted 
linear combination\cite{achaz2009frequency}. More precisely, 
the weights should be positive and sum to 
one, which called a convex combination, aka discrete 
expectation. For 
example, 
test statistics for Tajima's $D$\cite{tajima1989statistical}, 
Fay Wu's $H$~\cite{fay2000hitchhiking} and 
SFSelect\cite{ronen2013learning} can be obtained by a dot 
product of SFS vector with their weight vector.

Whether the dynamic of SFS in times-series can improve the detection power in 
the conditions (i-iii) is not well-studied yet. Evans et al. 
\cite{evans2007non} developed diffusion equations for 
evolution of SFS in time series, they are difficult to solve. 
Hence, we analyze and visualize scalar test statistics $D$, $H$ and SFSelect 
in the dynamic data under different selection regimes.

To adapt SFS-based test for dynamic data, one can simply design statistical 
tests to examine whether the 
observations of $D$, $H$ and SFSelect statistics are 
significantly deviated 
from the null distribution, i.e. constant values in time.
On the other hand, we can model the dynamics of SFS as a 
function of selection 
strength to 1)have a model for estimating model parameter 2)obtain an insight 
regarding how does SFS statistics behave under different 
stages of selection.

As mentioned before, restricting population to $F$ founder lines ($F<<N_e$) 
resembles a severe bottleneck event, which confound SFS. Figure 
\ref{fig:bottleneck} demonstrates effect of controlled experimental evolution 
on different SFS statistics under neutral evolution for 1000 simulations. The 
mean of 
neutral simulations can be used to empirically filter out the effect of 
bottleneck in dynamic data. 

\begin{enumerate}[I.]
	\item {\bf Tajima's D}. As shown in the Appendix \ref{app:td}, dynamic of 
	Tajima's D in hard sweep is
	\beq
	D_t=D_0-\log(1-\nu_t) \frac{W_0}{\log(2N)} -\nu_t^2 \Pi_0\label{eq:tdt}
	\eeq

	where $W_0$ and $\Pi_0$ are Watterson and Tajima estimate 
	of $\theta$ at 
	the first generation.
	Given that $\nu_t$ defined in term of $\nu_0$ and $s$ in 
	\eqref{eq:nut}, we 
	can use \eqref{eq:tdt} to estimate the strength of 
	selection by performing a nonlinear 
	regression to find 
	$s$. Then, a likelihood ratio, similar to \eqref{eq:lrt}, 
	provides\footnote{The 
	likelihood of the data to the model is the least-squares 
	loss between model 
	$D_t(\hat{(s)})$ and the observed $D$.} a predictor for 
	detecting selection in each window. Figures \ref{fig:dynamic-weak} and 
	\ref{fig:dynamic-strong} (last 
	row, left), shows that the parametric model with the actual value of $s$ 
	provides is consistent with 1000 simulations, in strong and weak 
	selections. Also, \eqref{eq:tdt} represents dynamic of $D$ in hard 
	sweep, and the 
	model becomes invalid as initial carrier frequency increases, Figure 
	\ref{fig:dynamic-weak} and \ref{fig:dynamic-strong} (last 
	row, right).
	
	Finally, even in a infinite population size setting, 
	differentiating the between selection and drift is difficult in early 
	generations. W.l.o.g when $D_0=0$ and $\Pi_0=W_0=1$, 
	$D_t$ is sum of the 
	logarithmic $\frac{-\log(1-\nu_t)}{\log(2N)}$ and the squared term 
	$\nu_t^2$, blue and green curves in 
	Figure 
	\ref{fig:tdterms}. As shown in the Figure 
	\ref{fig:tdterms} right, in early 
	generations of hard sweep where carrier frequency is low, 
	$D_t$ is either 
	positive or close zero. In other words, the reduction in 
	diversity become 
	significant when carrier frequency is high.
	
	
	
	\item {\bf Fay Wu's H} As shown in the Appendix \ref{app:h}, dynamic $H$ 
	statistic is directly related to average HAF \cite{ronen2015predicting} and 
	can be written
	\beq
	nH_t= \theta \nu_t \left(\frac{\nu_t+1}{2} - \frac{1}{(1-\nu_t)n+1}\right) +
	\theta (1-\nu_t)\left(\frac{n+1}{2n}-\frac{1}{(1-\nu_t)n+1}\right) 
	\label{eq:ht}
	\eeq
	which is a good approximation only in hard sweep with strong selection, 
	Figures 
	\ref{fig:dynamic-weak} and \ref{fig:dynamic-strong} (second
	row, left). Similar to $D$, it can be shown that $H$ statistics for natural 
	selection behave similar to that of neutral evolution in early generations 
	of hard sweep, where carrier frequency is not high.
	
	\item {\bf SFSelect} statistic proposed by Ronen et 
	al. \cite{ronen2013learning} to predict selection by empirically learning 
	the so-called \emph{optimal} weights using Support Vector Machines. 
	Figure \ref{fig:dynamic-weak} and \ref{fig:dynamic-strong} (forth
	row), depicts the dynamics of SFSelect for selection and neutral evolution 
	in time, which essentially behave similar to $D$ and $H$, i.e. poor power 
	of detection in soft sweep, and early generations of hard sweep.
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Detecting Selection}
To evaluate detection power of the proposed method, least-squares (LS), we 
compare it with Gaussian process (GP) \cite{Terhorst2015Multi}, FIT 
\cite{feder2014Identifying},  SFselect \cite{ronen2015predicting}, 
$D$\cite{tajima1989statistical}, and $H$ \cite{fay2000hitchhiking} statistics.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Least-Squares Estimate of $s$} 
\label{sec:regression}
In a simplest case, we have 2 observations, $x_0$ and $x_t$ and we wish to find 
$\hat{s}$ so that $x_t=\sigma(\hat{s}t/2+\eta{x_0})$ which can be solved 
analytically:
\begin{equation}
\hat{s}=\frac{2}{t} \log \left( \frac{x_t(1-x_0)}{x_0 (1-x_t)} \right) = 
\frac{2}{t}  \left( \eta(x_t)-\eta(x_0)\right)
\label{eq:naive2point}
\end{equation}
which selection coefficient can be regarded as for the
selection coefficient as normalized increment in log-odds space.

However, with more than two observations, the system become over determined and 
we need to solve $T$ set of equations. By re-arranging 
\eqref{eq:naive2point}, we can write a set of linear equations

\beq
\frac{t}{2}s&=\eta(x_t)-\eta(x_0) \ \ \ \ \ \forall t \in \Tc \\ 
\eeq
which can be written in matrix form $\bft s =\bfb$ with
\beq
\bft=\begin{bmatrix}
	\tau_1\\
	\vdots \\
	\tau_T
\end{bmatrix}
\bfb=\begin{bmatrix}
 2(\eta(x_{\tau_1})-\eta(x_0))\\
	\vdots \\
2\eta(x_{\tau_T})-\eta(x_0))
\end{bmatrix}, \ \ \ \ \ 
\eeq
and the solution is can be computer using psudo inverse

\beq
\hat{s}=\bft^+\bfb=(\bft^T\bft)^{-1}\bft^T\bfb=\frac{\bft^T\bfb}{\|\bft\|^2}
\eeq
it can be shown that 
\beq
s^*= \frac{1}{R} \sum_r^R \hat{s}_r = \bft^+\bar{\bfb}
\eeq
where $\bar{\bfb}$ is the average of $\bfb$ over $R$ replicates.
Finally, for each replicate, instead of $T$ equations where each observation is 
compared with $x_0$, we can take all possible pairs and solve ${T \choose 2}$ 
set of equations.



\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Allele frequencies under selective sweep} \label{app:af}
Let in a dialellic diploid Wright-Fisher model with single locus selection, 
with genotypes 0|0, 0|1 and 1|1 , $w_{00}$, $w_{01}$ and  $w_{11}$ be the 
relative fitness of each genotype at a locus. Also, consider $x$ to be 
frequency of the allele 1 and allele 1 be the favored allele, then
\beq
&w_{00}=1,&w_{01}=1+us,&w_{11}=1+s
\eeq
\beq
x_{t+1}&=\frac{w_{11}x_t^2 + w_{01}x(1-x_t)}{w_{11}x^2_t + 2w_{01}x_t(1-x_t) + 
w_{00}(1-x_t)^2} =x_t+\frac{s(h+(1-2u)x_t)x_t(1-x_t)}{1+sx_t(2u+(1-2u)x_t))} 
\eeq
where $s\in \Rbb$ is the selection coefficient and $o\in[0,1]$ is the 
overdominance parameter which for $u=0.5$ we have
\begin{equation}
x_{t+1}=x_t+\frac{sx_t(1-x_t)}{2+2sx_t}\;.
\label{eq:transition}
\end{equation}
we also have
\beq
\frac{\bfd x_t}{\bfd t} = \frac{sx_t(1-x_t)}{2+2sx_t}
\eeq
which is a differential equation that is difficult to solve. However if take 
the approximation $2+2sx_t \approx 2$, it becomes an ordinary differential 
equation that can be readily solved

\begin{equation}
\nu_t =\frac{1}{1+\frac{1-x_0}{x_0}e^{-st/2}} = \sigma(st/2+\eta(x_0)) 
\label{eq:inf-pop}
\end{equation}
where$\sigma(.)$ is the logistic
function and $\eta(.)$ is logit function (inverse of the logistic function). 

\subsubsection{Fay Wu's H}\label{app:h}
\bl
In any finite population size of $n$ with $m$ segregating sites, 
allele frequencies take 
discrete values, i.e.,  $x_j \in 
\{\frac{1}{n},\frac{2}{n},\ldots,\frac{n-1}{n}\}, \ \forall j \in{1,\cdot,m}$ 
and we can write
\beq
\|\bfx\|^2= \sum_{j=1}^{m} x_j^2 = 
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left(\frac{i}{n}\right)^2\xi_i= 
\frac{ (n-1)}{2n}H 
\eeq
where $\xi_i$ is the number of sites with frequency $i/n$ and $H$ is the 
Fay \& Wu's estimate of $\theta$.
\el

Recently, Ronen et al. ~\cite{ronen2015predicting} devised the $1\dHAF$ 
statistic for identifying selection on static data, which has the expeceted 
value related to the $\|\bfx\|^2$:
\begin{equation} 
\Ebb[1\dHAF(t)]= n\| \bfx_t\|^2\approx ng(\nu_t)
\end{equation} 
where
\beq
g(\nu_t)= \theta \nu_t \left(\frac{\nu_t+1}{2} - \frac{1}{(1-\nu_t)n+1}\right) +
\theta (1-\nu_t)\left(\frac{n+1}{2n}-\frac{1}{(1-\nu_t)n+1}\right)
\label{eq:hafscorepooled}
\eeq
where easily follows that
\beq
\theta_H(t)=\frac{n-1}{2} g(\nu_t)
\eeq

\subsection{Tajima's D}\label{app:td}
Let $D_0, \Pi_0, W_0$, be Tajima's D, Tajima's estimate of  $\theta$, and 
Watterson's estimate of $\theta$ at time zero and $D_0=\Pi_0 - W_0$.
In order to compute, $D_t=\Pi_t - W_t$ we compute $\Pi_t$ and $W_t$ separately 
as follows.

Let $P$ be the $n \times n$ matrix of pairwise heterozygosity if individuals, 
then $\Pi=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum P_{ij}$. So, if the population consist of $\nu n$ 
identical carrier haplotype (due to lack of recombination), their pairwise 
hamming distance is zero and should be subtracted from the total $\Pi_t$:
\beq
\Pi_t&= (1-\nu_t^2)\Pi_0 
\eeq

To compute $W_t$, first remember that $W_t= \frac{m_t}{S_n}$ where $m_t$ is the 
number of segregating sites at time $t$ and $S_n= \sum_i^n 1/i \approx 
\log(n)$. Also we have
\beq
\frac{W_t}{W_0}&=\frac{\frac{m_t}{S}}{\frac{m_0}{S}} \ \ \Rightarrow 
W_t=\frac{m_t}{m_0}W0 
\eeq
where $m_t$ to be interpreted as the expected number of segregating sites at 
time $t$, under neutral evolution. At time $t$, the number of individuals that 
undergone neutral evolution is $(1-\nu_t)n +1$, which leads to
\beq
\frac{m_t}{m_0}&=\frac{\log\left((1-\nu_t)n +1 \right)\theta}{\log(n)\theta} 
\approx  
\frac{\log\left((1-\nu_t)n\right)}{\log(n)} = \frac{\log(1-\nu_t)+\log(n)}{\log(n)} = 
1+ \frac{ \log(1-\nu_t)}{\log(n)} 
\eeq
putting all together 
\beq
D_t&= (1-\nu_t^2)\Pi_0 - (1+ \frac{ \log(1-\nu_t)}{\log(n)} ) W_0 = 
D_0-\log(1-\nu_t) \frac{W_0}{\log(n)} -\nu_t^2 \Pi_0
\eeq


\subsection{Linkage Disequilibrium}
Nonrandom associations between polymorphisms are established in the 
substitution process according to the phylogeny, broken by recombination events 
and reinforced by selection. Although in EE the experiments with pooled 
sequencing, LD can not be measured throughout evolution, it is still worthwhile 
to examine the behavior of LD as a result of the interaction between 
recombination and natural selection, to take into account of some of EE 
implicit constraints. 

Let $\rho_0$ be the LD at time zero between the site under selection and a 
segregating site $l$ base-pairs away, then under natural selection we have
\beq
\rho_t= \alpha_t\beta_t \rho_0=e^{-rtl} \left(\frac{H_t}{H0}\right)  
\rho_0\label{eq:ldt}
\eeq
where $H_T=2\nu_0(1-\nu_0)$ is the heterozygousity at the selected site, $r$ is 
the recombination rate/bp/gen. The decay factor $\alpha_t=e^{-rtl}$ is the 
product of recombination and growth factor $\beta_t$ (eq. 30-31 in 
\cite{Stephan2006The})is the outcome of 
selection. For $s=0.01$, $l=100K$bp, the log of decay, growth and product of 
both is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ldf}. It is evident that, for these 
parameters LD does not start to decay until generation 1000, which would be  
problematic when $\rho_0$. For example, in the case of hard sweep, the 
selection is imposed on the site with minimum AF, which is at perfect linkage 
($|D'|=1$) with all the other loci.\footnote{This is because, between the 
	selected site and all the other sites frequency of one gamete is zero.}
We this phenomenon is shown in the Figures \ref{fig:ld2d}, \ref{fig:ld3d} where 
at generation zero the site at position 500K is at perfect linkage with all the 
other sites, and linkage of the middle site with all the genome is depicted 
for both genetic drift and natural selection, in different generations.
Also, a window of 50Kbp around the selected site is shaded in Figure 
\ref{fig:ld2d} to demonstrate the value of LD in the window under drift and 
hard sweep. This implies that the precision of locating the selection on the 
genome is tightly dependent on a set of parameters including, recombination 
rate, selection strength, initial carrier frequency, and the initial linkage.
