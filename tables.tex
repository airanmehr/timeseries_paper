	\caption{Percentage of simulations in which the favored allele is ranked first 
          (A-B); 
          appears in top 10 (C-D); or,  appears in top 50 (E-F). In soft sweep 
          simulations (B,D,F), the ranks are consistently better than 
          hard sweep simulations (A,C,E). This can be attributed to lower LD between the 
          hitchhikers (false positives) and favored allele in soft sweep scenarios.}\label{tab:rank}
