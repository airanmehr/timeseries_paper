\section{Introduction}
Until very recently, biological data analysis has been considered processing a snapshot of data. However, the emergence of NGS and related technologies has made it possible to not only create larger datasets but also to measure multiple observations of the same quantity in the course of time. In many cases, such as population genetics, it is of the great interest to model the evolutionary process and make inferences, predictions and retrospective studies. Indeed, a random process is better explained by time series data than a single observation.

In addition to inexpensive data availability, over last two decades, a large amount of efforts is dedicated to High-Performance Computing (HPC), which re-popularized and re-branded computationally intensive algorithms such as Neural Networks. The first properly proposed neural network model to exploit full potential of multi layer neural networks published by \cite{deep-DR, deep-belief} and its spectacular performance on image processing problems immediately spawned the field of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), aka Deep Learning. Shortly, DNNs has made breakthroughs in generative models \cite{deep-generative}, speech processing \cite{deep-speech}, natural language processing \cite{deep-nlp}, etc the tasks that they are originally indented to accomplish \cite{deep-imagenet}.
