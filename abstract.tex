  Experimental evolution (EE) studies are powerful tools for observing
  molecular evolution ``in-action'' from populations sampled in
  controlled and natural environments. The advent of next generation
  sequencing technologies has made whole-genome and whole-population
  sampling possible, even for eukaryotic organisms with large genomes,
  and allowed us to locate the genes and variants responsible for
  genetic adaptation. While many computational tests have been
  developed for detecting regions under selection, they are mainly
  designed for static (single time) data, and work best when the
  favored allele is close to fixation.
	
  EE studies provide samples over multiple time points, underscoring
  the need for tools that can exploit the data. At the same time, EE
  studies are constrained by the limited time span since onset of
  selection, depending upon the generation time for the organism. This
  constraint impedes adaptation and optimization studies, as the
  population can only be propagated for a small number of generations,
  relative to the fixation time of the favored allele.  Moreover,
  sequencing depths of pooled experiments vary across replicates and
  time points, leading to ascertainment bias.
	
  In this article, we directly address these issues while developing
  tools for identifying selective sweep in short-term and
  pool-sequenced experimental evolution of sexual organisms and
  propose Composition of Markov Likelihoods for `Evolve And
  Resequence' experiments (\comale) . Extensive simulations show that
  \comale\ achieves higher detection power over a wide range of
  parameters, including both soft and hard sweep scenarios, and is
  many orders of magnitude faster than other methods, making genomic
  scans feasible.  We apply the \comale\ statistic to the controlled
  experimental evolution of D. melanogaster to detect adaptive
  genes/alleles under alternating cold and hot temperatures, and
  identify many genes that are adapting to the selection constraints.
