  (A) Typical configuration in which time-series data is collected for
  \dmel. A small set of founder lines ($F=200$) is selected from a
  large population ($N_o=10^{6}$), and used to create a sub-population
  of isofemale lines. Multiple replicates of the population are
  evolved and resequenced to collect time-series genomic data. For
  sequencing, $n$ individuals are randomly sampled and sequenced with
  coverage $\lambda$.  (B) Graphical model showing dependence of the
  random variables in the single-locus model used to compute \comale\
  statistics. Observed variables, $c$ (derived allele read count) and
  $d$ (total read count) are shaded. The variables $\nu,y,\lambda$
  denote allele frequency, sampled allele frequency, and mean
  sequencing coverage, respectively. (C) Mean and 95\% confidence
  interval of the theoretical (i,iii) and empirical (ii,iv)
  trajectories of the favored allele for hard (i,ii) and soft (iii,iv)
  sweep scenarios and $N=1000$.  The first $50$ generations are shaded
  in gray to represent the sampling span of sampling in short-term
  experiments, illustrating the difficulty in predicting selection at
  early stages of selective sweep.  }
